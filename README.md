# Overview
An Application Built with React and Redux which Gives All important data of github user in very decent fashion and lot more cool feature yet to be added
It could be really useful for those who are willing to hire any developer,It provides very readable data of github users & lot more feautures are yet to be added

# Setup 

Install Dependcies-

```
  npm install
```

Run Server-

```
  npm run dev
```


# Working
I have Used <code>React.js</code> for handling the client side of the application,the app don't have any server side,so it does not contain any databases to store the data.Also I Used <code>Redux</code> for managing the different states of the application.Redux is a great state manager for react like <code>Flux</code>,<code>MobX</code>

# Redux Brief:-
In Redux we have the following processes:-
<ul>
	<li>actions:-A action is all about the user actions like onclick,onChange etc.</li>
	<li>reducers:-A reducer is something which returns a state after some user actions get fired.</li>
	<li>containers:-This is very similar to react components,The only thing which make it different is components are stateless(Dumb) but containers are statefull and changes the view as state changes.
So Using them is a good practice to keep your project structure more elegant.</li>
</ul>
